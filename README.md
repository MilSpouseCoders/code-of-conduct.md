# MilSpouseCoders
## Code Of Conduct

### Purpose
MilSpouseCoders is dedicated in providing a fun, support, and harassment-free community and learning experience for everyone. We expect all members to show respect and courtesy to others through our Chapter Meetings, Virtual Code&Coffees, and workshops. Sexual imagery is not appropriate for any MilSpouseCoders events. MilSpouseCoders participants violating these rules will be expelled from our events or online discussion boards immediately upon discovery. 

### Harassment
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Adults who identify as men are welcome at our events, and it is expected that all participants be treated with equal respect. We do not tolerate harassment of MilSpouseCoders participants in any form. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are to comply immediately.

### What To Do If You Witness Or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior
If you are being harassed, noticed that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact your local Chapter Leader(s) immediately. 
MilSpouseCoders Chapter Leaders/Teachers/Event Organizers will be happy to help members contact local law enforcement, provide escorts when possible.

MilSpouseCoders expects participants to follow these rules at all MilSpouseCoders events and in online discussion boards.
